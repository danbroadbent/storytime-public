## AI Bedtime Story Generator

This project is a personal project to make custom bedtime stories for my kids leveraging the OpenAI API and ChatGPT that I did for fun. It leverages React/Typescript, an Ionic UI Library, and a Firebase backend. I have removed the git history to protect my OpenAI API key from being exposed. This project also does not showcase any testing as it was a greenfield project with lots of experimentation that did not need to meet robust commercial standards.

## Repo Structure

You will find the majority of the frontend code in the /src directory. The frontend does do some direct database manipulation, which can be found in the /services directory. The rest of the backend functionality can be found in the /functions directory.
